     Description
     
     Switch is a very simple program to change the 'Jump'
     status of a session.  There's really not a lot to say
     except to run Switch and choose the session you want to
     toggle as 'Jumpable' or 'Non-Jumpable'.
     
     A later revision may make this program a PM
     application.  But that could be far into the future. .
